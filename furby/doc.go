/*
Package furby provides a Gobot driver for Furbies, which are treated as a General Purpose Input/Output device.

Although a Furby itself doesn't have an on/off device, by wiring its power to a GPIO pin, we can control its on/off via GPIO state toggles.

Control of the Furby's behavior itself is dependent upon audio signals.
